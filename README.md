I implemented a personalized VPN using WireGuard VPN

In these repositories, two folders correlate to their separate docker containers. The first one is for a personalized domain to have easy global access to your home server. The second one is for the WireGuard VPN setup. Make sure the compose files are used correctly to create their separate containers.
