I implemented a custom VPN using WireGuard to provide secure, remote, and global access to a personal home server, replicating the functionality of a local network from any location. To streamline management, I deployed the VPN within a Docker container, ensuring seamless compatibility across multiple operating systems and devices. This approach enhanced both accessibility and usability, delivering a reliable and user-friendly solution.
In this repository, two folders correlate to their separate docker containers. The first one is for a personalized domain to have easy global access to your home server. The second one is for the WireGuard VPN setup. Make sure the compose files are used correctly to create their separate containers.
